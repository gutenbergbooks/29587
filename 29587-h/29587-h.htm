<h2>NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>The Loom of Life was published late in 1912. It has had an unusual
sale for a first volume of poetry, and there is still a steady demand
for the book, which has been out of print for some months. This
Second Edition is issued to meet that demand.</p>

<span class="i0">A cabin! It nestled amid the green hills<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where grew no bramble or thistle,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid meadows melodious with music and trills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And song that the wild-throated mocking bird spills<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the air from his marvelous whistle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No carpets were seen on the broad puncheon floors,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No paintings that wealth would reveal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a statue was there that Art can not know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That filled the rude room with a musical glow,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Twas Ruth at the Old Spinning Wheel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long years have passed by; its music was stilled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At rattle and whirr of machinery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pea-fowl now screams where the mocking bird trilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the landscape is dead where once the heart thrilled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At wildwood and picturesque scenery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The opera may boast the diva of song,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To me she makes no appeal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flute obligato my heart is still dumb,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Of Ruth and the Old Spinning Wheel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She lived but a simple, plain rustic life,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">At the shrine of her heart do I kneel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a prayer no mortal ever lifted above,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the radiant smile of my love when she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Why James, you know that I love you."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nymph-like her lithe form swayed as in dance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A moment's surcease of monotonous thrum,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The glow of the incandescent light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Has banished the tallow candle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ox-cart is gone at steam's rapid flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Love is too subtle, is too recondite<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For Learning or Genius to handle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All honor to Science, let her keep her mad pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I abate not a tittle her zeal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the splendors of life can never efface<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The picture of Ruth in plain rustic grace<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have you never heard the story of the good old country school<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its rude split-bottomed benches and its ancient <i>dunce's stool</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Webster's Blue-back Speller was the only standard text,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And supplied the place of grammar that our late forefathers vexed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they never heard of Latin or the Greek subjunctive mode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sang their mult-plication like a patriotic ode?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Master, he was skinny, with a lean and hungry look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a countenance as placid as a frozen winter brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brow was broad and Grecian, and his eye was snell and keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his head was stuffed with knowledge of a dozen books, I ween;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they say his nose was Roman as the bill of any hawk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his boys were all perfection, for they had to walk the chalk.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And yet I've often wondered if they really always walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat upright like statues, and never laughed or talked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I've often heard my father say the model of the school<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span><span class="i0">Got licked at least three times a day as a pretty general rule,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of imparting knowledge in a way that made a fellow <i>smart</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wish we had the secret now of making boys walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of always watching for a chance to throw some chalk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the art, I think, was buried with the Blue-back Spelling Book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the piercing eye of Skinny, that no mortal boy could brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas buried with the benches and the ancient dunce's stool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grease-glazed paper windows of the good old country school.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It may be through psychology and molly-coddle stuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We often talk in institutes, we've lost the power to bluff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps 'twas Pestalozzi, Froebel and John Herbart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who robbed the wand of Skinny of its pedagogic art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll not discuss philosophy, but we know about the chalk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no theoretic dream of man can make a boy walk.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Every living soul you meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking comet on the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should you occupy the pews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See the Hipp or read the news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall asleep and chance to dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halley's comet still the theme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dust to-day got in my eye,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halley's comet passing by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both the sense of sound and sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffering from this comet's blight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the days were hot and dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halley's comet in the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through April frost and rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halley's comet raising Cain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoso seeks for faith or knowledge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes to church or enters college,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears naught else but this discussed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shooting stars and comet dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taft and Teddy's well be dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Old England's monarch <i>Ed</i>,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as well as be forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midst this meteoric rot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Automobile passes by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a comet in the sky.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><span class="i0">Leaving in its awful trail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreaths of smoke just like a tail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See a fellow sniff the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stop, turn pale, and trembling, swear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wonder now has science lied?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gas smells like cyanide."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learned, ign'rant, rich and poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All are full of comet lore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life had charms that once were sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, hast now no safe retreat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this talk will not abate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, I pray this be our fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May this globe dissolve or fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing through the comet's tail!<br /></span>
